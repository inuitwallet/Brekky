Toast:

2 types of user. Content providers (bakers) and content consumers (toasters) 

Bakers: 
Plugin to api. 
API provides an address tied to their brekky account
They display that to their consumer who pays the amount requested (either directly or with eggs? (brekky tokens) 
Once the payment is confirmed the brekky api informs the bakers system that the payment is complete and they allow access to their content
